# Medifakt Token (FAKT)

The FAKT token is the native currency of the Medifakt blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## FAKT utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Medifakt blockchain, FAKT is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Medifakt to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.medifakt.network/](https://status.medifakt.network/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked FAKT. Which means validators with higher amounts of Medifakt staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any FAKT holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of FAKT they wish. They receive a share of the Medifakt block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As FAKT is the native currency on Medifakt, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, FAKT transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of FAKT tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Medifakt platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
