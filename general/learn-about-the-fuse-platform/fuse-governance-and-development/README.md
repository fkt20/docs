# Medifakt Governance and Development

Medifakt is already a significantly decentralized platform and plans are in motion to achieve full community control over it in the future. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** Medifakt validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt [Medifakt improvement proposals](https://docs.medifakt.network/general/fips) (FIPs).  Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **Medifakt Foundation and the project team**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the Medifakt treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis FAKT supply (see the subsection "[FAKT Supply and Current Distribution](https://docs.medifakt.network/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)") are currently mostly managed by a foundation. For Medifakt, this role is played by Gibraltar-incorporated company Medifakt Limited.

Medifakt Foundation **employs the Medifakt project team** whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://medifakt.network/about).

The project team implements network protocol updates adopted by the validators, other protocol changes that do not require validator votes, maintains the full node software. It develops the mobile-centric infrastructure for creating and managing token communities on Medifakt. It also works on boosting the adoption of the network through improving the Medifakt tech stack, securing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects and marketing the platform within the crypto space and beyond.

That said, since Medifakt is a decentralized public blockchain platform, **no permission of the project team is required** for anyone who wishes to integrate with or develop on top of Medifakt, including the development of the network and node software.

3\) **Medifakt Assembly.** See the Assembly [page](https://docs.medifakt.network/general/fuse-governance/fuse-assembly) for more details.  &#x20;
